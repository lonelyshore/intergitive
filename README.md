# intergitive -- Learn `git` by using it, with graphical interface!

`intergitive` aims to guide **anyone** who wants to use git to develop projects collaboratively. It teaches using a git [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) interactively. 

For a gentle guide to how to use it and more details, please refer to the [introduction below](#introduction)  
As for introductions to how to contribute to this project, please refer to the [contribution guides](docs/contribution-guides/en.md)

### Goal

Have you ever or are you suffered from using git? Are these situations familiar to you?  
- I can read every sigle word in the git document, but I just don't understand what it means when they are put together.
- Followed the steps from the tutorial/Q&A, but the result is different from what they said.
- Blow up my repository accidentally and lost my progress. I needed to spend lots of time to fix it or re-do my work. 
- Online materials such as tutorials or Q&As target the daunting git command line interface. I would really appreciate a tutorial for my beloved git GUI.  

If you have any of the above problems, `intergitive` can help you!  

`intergitive` is designed to help **anyone** who wants to use git to develop projects collaboratively. Here are the features:  
- It comprises of comprehensive explanations and use illustrations to help them easy to understand
  - For example, here is a quote of explanation of "checkout" from the [git official site](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout):
  ```
    Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If no pathspec was given, git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.
  ```
  - And here is how `intergitive` says about the same thing
    ![checkout-example](screenshots/checkout-illustration.png)  
- `intergitive` explains working mechanism and concepts of git in addition to instructions of how to operate it
- It guides a user with an interactive "operate-and-verify" mechanism to ensures a user stays on track and has a great sense of progression
  - For example, teaching a three-steps operation in a statical tutorial may look like:
    - The tutorial lists all the steps
    - The reader follows them one by one
    - The tutorial may provide the expected result of the operation
    - The reader can compare his/her own result against the expected one. However, even if the reader knows the result is wrong, he/she would have no idea of what went wrong...üôà
  - In `intergitive`, the process is like:  
    - It shows how to do the first step, the reader follows.
    - When the reader completes, he/she triggers `intergitive` to check if the result is as expected, as shown below
      ![interactive-1](docs/readme/screenshots/interactive-en-1.png)
      - If the result is as expected, the reader may continue on.
        ![interactive-2](docs/readme/screenshots/interactive-en-2.png)
      - On the other hand, the reader knows the last step was incorrect, reverts it back, and tries again.
        ![interactive-3](docs/readme/screenshots/interactive-en-3.png)
    - The reader continues until reaching the goal üèÅ  
- A reader learns how to use a friendly git GUI instead of the formidable CLI. Currently `intergitive` supports:  
  - [fork](https://git-fork.com/)(English version is WIP)
  - [Git Extensions](http://gitextensions.github.io/)(WIP)

### Installation and Execution

- Download the `intergitve` bundle from the link listed above.  
- Uncompress the zip file. Choose a directory to put the extracted folder.  
  - Because of technical limitation, please avoid locating it in a directory that is monitored by git.
  - If you are unsured about what "monitored by git" means, you probably do not need to worry about it. Please choose any folder you would like to.
- Open the extracted folder after uncompression is completed. There should be a executable file named `intergitive.exe` inside it.  
- To launch `intergitive`, execute the executable.
